CENG 4999 - Final Year Project
KWS2401 â€“ Robotic system development

This project is about implementing a rodent detection model for a rodent monitoring system base on YOLOv11
This repository is the code use for the model training

Installation:
Install the ultralytics package, including all requirements, in a Python>=3.8 environment with PyTorch>=1.8. By the following code:
pip install ultralytics

then clone the content of this repository to use the custom model.


Usage:
User could use the 'model training.ipynb' for custom model training and model testing

You can use Ultralytics YOLO directly from the Command Line Interface (CLI) with the `yolo` command:

```bash
# Predict using a pretrained YOLO model (e.g., YOLO11n) on an image
yolo predict model=yolo11n.pt source='https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg'
```

The `yolo` command supports various tasks and modes, accepting additional arguments like `imgsz=640`. Explore the YOLO [CLI Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cli/) for more examples.

### Python

Ultralytics YOLO can also be integrated directly into your Python projects. It accepts the same [configuration arguments](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cfg/) as the CLI:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pretrained YOLO11n model
model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

# Train the model on the COCO8 dataset for 100 epochs
train_results = model.train(
    data="coco8.yaml",  # Path to dataset configuration file
    epochs=100,  # Number of training epochs
    imgsz=640,  # Image size for training
    device="cpu",  # Device to run on (e.g., 'cpu', 0, [0,1,2,3])
)

# Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set
metrics = model.val()

# Perform object detection on an image
results = model("path/to/image.jpg")  # Predict on an image
results[0].show()  # Display results

# Export the model to ONNX format for deployment
path = model.export(format="onnx")  # Returns the path to the exported model
```
